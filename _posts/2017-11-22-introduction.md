Hi and welcome to our website. This is going to be the main website for our programming team. So far, the team consists of five members: Me(Gary Barnes), Duncan McClean, Euan Buchanan and Ross Bain. This website should keep you updated on all things that are going on in the world of technology such as fabulous new devices or horrible technical flops. There are no set days for blogs to be uploaded, they will simply be uploaded when we have an update or time on our hands.
Thanks for reading!
